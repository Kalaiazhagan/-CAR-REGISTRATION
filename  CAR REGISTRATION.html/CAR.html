    <h2>Recent Test Results</h2>
    <P>
        In the latest Global NCAP crash tests, the Honda Amaze scored poorly in the child occupant protection category, leading to its diminished safety rating. This marks a stark contrast from five years ago when the model received a commendable four-star rating. The tests were conducted under the new protocols introduced by Global NCAP in the previous year.

    <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        The Honda Amaze displayed inadequacies in ensuring the safety of child occupants during frontal impact tests. Issues such as poor protection of the child’s head, chest, and neck were observed, particularly for children aged 1.5 years. The absence of essential safety features like three-point seat belts in all seats contributed to the sedan’s subpar performance in child occupant protection tests.
